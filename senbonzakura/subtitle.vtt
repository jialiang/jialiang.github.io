1
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100
After a bold and audacious Westernization revolution.

2
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.240
This is now an open and upright anti-war nation.

3
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.340
As I pedal forward my bicycle marked with the Japanese flag, evil spirits will disperse from my ICBM.

4
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.580
Looping the belt line,

5
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.690
I don't care if I'm constantly on the move.

6
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.420
Boys and girls must be unrivaled during the warring era.

7
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.530
In the floating world,

8
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.660
Thousands of cherry trees dissolve into the night

9
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.770
Not even your voice will reach.

10
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.900
This is a banquet inside a steel jail cell.

11
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.000
Look down on us from your guillotine.

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.110
The whole world is shrouded in hellish darkness.

13
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.240
Not even a lamenting song is audible. With your raygun, shoot out the azure sky and the far distance.

14
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.430
Hundreds of fights will give one the apperance of an officer.

15
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.570
The courtesans are going here and there on a parade for their regular guests.

16
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.670
Everyone, assemble here now!

17
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.810
It's a march of the saints. One! Two! Three! Four!

18
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.910
To pass through the gate to Zen

19
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.020
and achieve nirvana with cleansing,

20
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.750
The closing act must be a happy finale. Accompanied by applause from the audience.

21
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.990
Thousands of cherry trees dissolve into the night.

22
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.090
Not even your voice will reach.

23
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.230
This is a banquet inside a steel jail cell.

24
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.330
Look down on us from your guillotine.

25
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.470
The whole world is shrouded in hellish darkness.

26
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.770
Not even a lamenting song is audible.

27
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.680
The hill of hope is in the far distance.

28
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.410
So shoot up your flashlight grenade.

29
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.480
Looping the belt line,

30
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.580
I don't care if I'm constantly on the move.

31
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.320
Boys and girls must be unrivaled during the warring era.

32
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.560
Thousands of cherry trees dissolve into the night.

33
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.660
Not even your voice will reach.

34
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.800
This is a banquet inside a steel jail cell.

35
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.900
So jump off from your guillotine.

36
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.040
Thousands of cherry trees dissolve into the night.

37
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.140
You will sing and I will dance.

38
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.240
This is a banquet inside a steel jail cell.

39
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.520
So shoot randomly and ceaselessly with your raygun.
