## What do you do at your current job?

Broadly, I propose, implement and maintain technical solutions to business problems.

I take on various responsibilities depending on the business priorities, whether that be the frontend, backend, database development or IT operations.

My tasks generally come with the goals of:

- Improving conversions (e.g. feature development, A/B testing).

## What is your current work arrangement?

# CULTURE FIT

## Why are you interested in our company?

I send each application after careful consideration rather than relying on large numbers.

I apply because I'm confident that I would contribute meaningfully, believe that our values align and feel positive about your company's offerings.

## How do you handle project deadlines?

I try to break down and tackle large tasks into smaller independently releasable chunks.
These tasks are then worked on in order of importance and urgency.

Frequent communication with stakeholders helps manage expectations.
E.g. time estimates, current progress, blockers etc.

## What is your ideal work environment?

My ideal work environment prioritises work-life balance along with a balanced pace and an outcome-oriented culture.

I thrive in a collaborative, supportive team with a focus on quality over quantity and open communication.

## Where do you see yourself in 3 years?

I see myself as a valuable member of your company with extensive knowledge and understanding of its business and technical domain.

I aim to become a trusted resource for colleagues and a key driver of progress.

# EXPERIENCE

## How do you stay updated?

I keep myself informed by engaging in online communities like Reddit.
A diverse range of articles and projects related to web development are shared and discussed there.

I also build personal projects from time to time to solve problems in my daily life.
These projects sometimes lead me to trying out new tools, technologies and methods.

## Have you led a team or mentored juniors?

I've mentored junior developers and collaborated closely with teammates.

I've provided support through code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing.

## Do you have experience with microservices?

Yes, I have experience building scalable and modular services.

I've used Docker for containerisation of services like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis and Elasticsearch.

I've also used RabbitMQ for messaging and PM2 for process management of cron and worker services.

## Do you know X? What about Y?

Chances are I've not worked directly with every technology listed in the job description.

Even so, technology evolves and businesses constantly adopt new tools.

What I offer instead is adaptability and problem solving skills. When we catch up, I would be happy to share some examples with you.
