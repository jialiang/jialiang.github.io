We help homeowners in the renovation process by providing services like recommendations, deposit safeguards and dispute resolution.

## How big is the team you're currently in?

At the moment, our tech team consists of 6 people.

## What do you do at your current job?

I propose, implement and maintain technical solutions to business problems.

I take on various responsibilities depending on the business priorities, whether that be the frontend, backend, database development or IT operations.

My tasks generally come with the goals of:

- Improving conversions (e.g. feature development, A/B testing).
- Improving efficiency (e.g. process automation, data transformation).
- Improving traffic (e.g. SEO improvements, page speed optimisation).
- Improving data collection (e.g. event-based tracking, journey analytics).
- Improving business intelligence (e.g. dashboard and reports).
- Improving reliability (e.g. application monitoring, error tracking).

## What is your current work arrangement?

I'm currently on a hybrid work arrangement of 1 day in the office and 4 days from home.

# CULTURE FIT

## Why are you interested in working at our company?

I send each application after careful consideration rather than relying on large numbers.

I apply because I'm confident that I would contribute meaningfully, believe that our values align and feel positive about your company's offerings.

## How do you handle project deadlines and prioritise tasks?

I try to break down and tackle large tasks into smaller independently releasable chunks.
These tasks are then worked on in order of importance and urgency.

Frequent communication with stakeholders helps manage expectations.
E.g. time estimates, current progress, blockers etc.

## Describe your ideal work environment.

My ideal work environment prioritises work-life balance along with a balanced pace and an outcome-oriented culture.

I thrive in a collaborative, supportive team with a focus on quality over quantity and open communication.

## Where do you see yourself in 3 years?

I see myself as a valuable member of your company with extensive knowledge and understanding of its business and technical domain.

I aim to become a trusted resource for colleagues and a key driver of progress.

# EXPERIENCE

## How do you stay updated with the latest web development trends and technologies?

I keep myself informed by engaging in online communities like Reddit.
A diverse range of articles and projects related to web development are shared and discussed there.

I also build personal projects from time to time to solve problems in my daily life.
These projects sometimes lead me to trying out new tools, technologies and methods.

## Have you led a development team or mentored junior developers?

I've mentored junior developers and collaborated closely with teammates.

I've provided support through code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing.

## Do you have experience with microservices?

Yes, I have experience building scalable and modular services.

I've used Docker for containerisation of services like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis and Elasticsearch.

I've also used RabbitMQ for messaging and PM2 for process management of cron and worker services.

## Do you know X? What about Y?

Chances are I've not worked directly with every technology listed in the job description.

Even so, technology evolves and businesses constantly adopt new tools.

What I offer instead is adaptability and problem solving skills. When we catch up, I would be happy to share some examples with you.

# NEXT JOB

## Do you prefer frontend or backend?

Generally I prefer front-end work but am fine with both.

## Why do you want to leave?

I'm happy with my current situation but am always open to new opportunities.

## When are you available for a call?

Generally, I'm available Tuesday to Friday after 10am.

## When can you start?

My current job requires a 2 month notice period.
